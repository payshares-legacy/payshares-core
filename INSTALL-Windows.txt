Build Dependencies
==================

- Download and install `Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6` (for Visual C++) from https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-2015-ctp-vs

- Download and install PostgreSQL 9.4.1 from http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
  The default project file defines USE_POSTGRES and links against it.
       * Pick a directory for the database
       * Set an admin password for the database
       * Accept the default port (5432)
       * Accept `default` for the locale (not clear if anything depends on this. The `default` locale will presumably depend on your
         operating system's setting might cause inconsistencies)
       * Add `c:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4\bin` to your PATH (else the binary will fail to start, not finding `libpq.dll`)
       *       If you install postgres in a different folder, you will have to update the project file in two places: "additional include locations" and "Linker input"

  If the installation fails, look into `%TEMP%\install-postgresql.log` for hints.


- In order to compile xdrc and run the binary you will need to either
       * Download and install mingw from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
          * * Add `C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;C:\MinGW\bin` to the end of `%PATH%`
       * Download and install cygwin from https://cygwin.com/install.html
          * Get cygwin setup to install `Flex` and `Bison`
          * Add `c:\cygwin\bin` to the end of `%PATH%`

- For making changes to the code, you should install the clang-format tool and Visual Studio extension, you can find both at http://llvm.org/builds/
